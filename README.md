## Usage
KLAW Web is an educational tool designed to help STEM teachers and hobbyists learn about robotics and programming. The platform allows users to design, build, program, and test robotic arms without having to develop a detailed understanding of the engineering concepts involved.

The app was designed in partnership with a team of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering students who constructed a robotic arm to be controlled with the web application.
